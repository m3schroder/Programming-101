# Programming-101

Directory that I'm using to teach some friends / family the basic of programming. 

The content is still a work in progress but eventually will include small projects written in C#, Javascript, and Python. The hope is that this multi-lingual
approach will help those learning extract the underlying principles of programming languages.
